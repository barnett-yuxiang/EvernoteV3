1. AI bot for a "helpful mail assistant" is being told how to ask a series of questions based on the content of an email. It could be part of Apple's Smart Reply feature, which can go on to suggest possible replies for you.

```

```

2. This sounds like Apple’s “Rewrite” feature, one of the Writing Tools that you can access by highlighting text and right-clicking (or, in iOS, long-pressing) on it. Its instructions include passages saying, “Please limit the answer within 50 words. Do not hallucinate. Do not make up factual information.”
